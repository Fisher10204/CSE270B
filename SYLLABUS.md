Catalog description
-------------------
Studio-based, and student inquiry driven, course in game development for the Atari 2600. Students will build experience in assembly language programming. Students will also investigate the ways that the Atari 2600's technical limitations influenced the development of the game design industry.

Pre-requisites
-----
Any introductory programming course (CSE 174, CSE 163, CSE 153, IMS 256, IMS 259, IMS 359), or instructor permission.

Grading
-------
I will use the standard CSE grading criteria in this course: 

* A: Complete mastery of essential topics
* B: Very good knowledge of essential topics
* C: Knowledge of essential topics, but some recognizable deficiencies
* D: Some familiarity with essential topics, but major areas of deficiency
* F: Seriously incomplete work or little evidence of knowledge of course topics

I do give +/- grades as appropriate.

The value of the course work will be divided as follows:

Conduct policy
-------------- 
The primary responsibility of a college professor is to create an environment in which all students have an equal opportunity to learn and succeed. For this reason, this course has a zero tolerance policy for discrimination, harassment, and academic misconduct. Appropriate definitions may be found in the student handbook. Violators of these policies will not receive warning: I will immediately report violations and seek the appropriate penalty for any such infraction. You must read and understand the CSE department expectations for Academic Integrity, http://www.eas.muohio.edu/fileadmin/departments/csa/downloads/AcademicIntegrity.pdf

Group work policy
------------
Most programming work in the course will require working in pairs. Furthermore, given that this is primarily a creative studio course, any and all types of collaboration are permissible on programming projects and creative projects. You are expected to share your work with your classmates multiple times per day for feedback, and help with debugging.

Written projects, however, (essays and so on) will normally be individual projects. 

Learning outcomes and course rationale
-----------------
Learning outcomes form the "specification" for this course. You are not expected to know the learning outcomes, but they are provided to help you understand what we plan to do, and why we are doing it. 

The course is aimed at three main audiences, with three main objectives:

1. With the resurgence of assembly programming (due to the widespread availability of SIMD on iPhone and Android), some students may desire to gain more experience with very careful assembly-language programming. Though this course does not use a modern chip, it will teach students the main ideas of highly effective assembly programming.
2. Many interactive media studies students are interested in platform studies, which is the study of how particular technological platforms influence and shape the development of interactive art forms, particularly games. In the past some IMS courses have tried to tackle this topic through readings, but readings alone are not enough to understand the issue. Instead, students need to really write games for the platform, to see how it constrains their design processes, leading to the invention of new genres of games.
3. Many computer science students and game professionals have a historical interest in the Atari 2600, as the first highly successful home game console. Just as English majors still study the sonnet form, there is something to be gained by studying and experiencing this historical platform.

Students will be able to...

1. ... design and create an interactive video game for Atari 2600, demonstrating a mastery of assembly language.
2. ... analyze an existing video game in terms of how its design was shaped by the technical limitations of the platform for which it was developed.
3. ... explain the historical importance of the Atari 2600 platform, and analyze contemporary games for influences originating from the Atari 2600.
